# Blog Post #3 - Story/Level Design and Development Plan

## Introduction

In this blog post, we will explore the story and narrative design of the game, giving an overview of the protagonist’s journey, the major themes, and the game’s narrative structure. We'll discuss how the story will unfold through levels, NPC interactions, and environmental storytelling, setting the stage for the player’s experience. This post will also cover the level design and progression, giving insight into how each area serves both the gameplay and narrative. Additionally, we’ll touch on the development plan moving forward, focusing on the mechanics and level design updates in the upcoming posts.

## Story and Narrative Design

**Core Premise**: The main protagonist, a lost soul with no memory of previous existence, wakes up in a hell-like world and must their way out of it, while they also uncover the truth about their past, the nature of the world, and the reason to why they are in this world. Furthermore, in the end of the final level, the protagonist will be sent back to the beginning of the first level. On this second journey, they will uncover more about the world they are in, their imprisonment and if an escape is even possible. Will there be more than one loop though? Have things changed since they were last there? (Plan so far is: 3 loops)

**Protagonist’s Goal**: Survive and escape the hostile environment they have found them self in.

**Major Themes**:

- **Moral Ambiguity**: Is the protagonist a victim, a sinner or something in between. The story will unfold throughout the game.
- **Escape vs. Acceptance**: Can this hellish place be escaped? Or does the main character have to accept their judgement.
- **Survival and Growth**: Overcoming overwhelming odds through skill and perseverance.

**Narrative Structure**: A linear progression, where the player moves through structured levels but has the options to explore secret areas for uncovering hidden lore that deepens the story.

**Story Delivery**: 

- **Omniscient Narrator**: The player will gain insight into the protagonist's thoughts and feelings through brief commentary provided by an omniscient narrator.
- **NPC Interactions**: The player will have the option to uncover lore from NPCs placed around the three levels.

- **Historian's Notes**: The player will encounter notes written by an anonymous historian that describe the world the protagonist is in.

## Level Design and Progression

The game's world is designed to reflect on the protagonist's journey. Furthermore, with each passing of a loop the protagonist can observe changes in the world. Between this levels, the player can find intermission areas where they can upgrade abilities or purchase items. All levels will be with focus on moving to the right. (More information on loops will be written when in development, as currently I have not created a detailed plan on the changes. So far the plan is to have environmental changes + enemies being stronger than before. New upgrades are added as well.)

**Level 0: Tutorial Cave** 

- The game begins with the protagonist waking up in a dark cave, their vision limited to the faint glow of a lantern they find. Soon after, they discover a small dagger-like sword—their sole weapon throughout the game. As they progress, the level introduces the fundamentals of movement and combat, gradually presenting environmental challenges and enemies. At the end of the level, they find an exit leading out of the cave.

**Level 1: Hills of Hell**

- The first official level after the tutorial takes place in a mountainous region, with towering peaks visible in the background. The protagonist must navigate through enemies and environmental challenges, defeating foes to earn score, which can be used later in the intermission area. The level concludes as they enter a secluded hut—the first intermission area.

**Level 2: The Forsaken Woods**

- The next level begins as the protagonist leaves the intermission area, entering a dense forest. Unlike the previous level, this area is more confined, featuring tighter environmental challenges and more frequent enemy encounters. Two new enemy types will be introduced here (detailed in the Development Plan section). The level concludes with the protagonist arriving at a hut, similar to the one from before, marking the next intermission area.

**Level 3: The Desert of the Lost**

- The next level begins as the protagonist leaves the intermission area and enters a vast desert. This stage introduces new environmental challenges and a new enemy type (detailed in the Development Plan section). The level concludes with the protagonist discovering a mysterious gate. Upon passing through it, they are unexpectedly transported back to the when the protagonist leaves the tutorial cave, marking the first repetition of the game.

**Intermission Areas**: 

- Each intermission area features the same shopkeeper, who offers upgrades, items, and insights into the world’s lore. However, the player can only afford one item, ability, or upgrade per visit, forcing them to make strategic choices about how they want to progress through the game.

## Development Plan 

This section outlines the development plan that will begin after this blog post. Blog Post #4 will provide updates on the development of movement and fighting mechanics, while Blog Post #5 will focus on the progress and updates regarding level design and development.

**Movement Mechanics**

- **Running + Jumping**: The player will be able to move freely and jump to navigate obstacles, enabling progression through the level.
- **Anchor points**: Certain areas in the levels will allow the player to jump and attach to anchor points, from which they can leap off to access otherwise unreachable areas. This mechanic not only aids in overcoming environmental obstacles but also adds a layer of strategic depth to combat, offering more movement options beyond basic walking and jumping.

**Fighting Mechanics**

- **Main Attack**: The player's primary attack consists of three stages:
  - **Stage One**: Horizontal slash
  - **Stage Two**: Vertical slash
  - **State Three**: Pierce with forward movement

- **Dive Attack**: While airborne, the player can perform a dive attack, delivering an area-of-effect strike by slamming the ground with their sword.
- **Launch Attack**: In contrast to the dive attack, the player can also launch themselves from the ground, executing another AOE attack as they propel upward.

**Enemies and NPCs**

- **Enemy Types**:
  - **Demons**: Melee (Tutorial + Level 1)
  - **Harvesters**: Melee + Range (Level 2)
  - **Sand Dwellers**: Range (Level 3)

- **NPCs**: (More information on their placement and dialogue can be found in Blog Post #5)

  - **Black and White Cat** (Level 0, 1, 2, 3)
    - No names, apart from being known as the Two
  - **Non-hostile Harvester** (Level 2)
    - Name: [TBD]
  - **Two Lost Souls** (Level 1)
    - No names
  - **Shop Keeper** (Intermission Levels)
    - No name/[TBD]
  - **Ancient Smith** (Level 3)
    - Name: Karrid

  - **Historian** (Secret NPC, found in Level 2 on the Third Loop)
    - No name

**Level Creation and Assets**

- Each level will be designed to be unique and engaging, with distinct elements in every loop to keep the player intrigued about the protagonist's journey and purpose.
- A mix of assets will be used, with some sourced from existing libraries and others custom-created by the developer to suit the game's aesthetic and gameplay needs.
